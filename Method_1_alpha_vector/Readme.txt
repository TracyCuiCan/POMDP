This folder contains the code for Method 1: Sondikâ€™s enumeration method. The main functions are infinite_horizon.m and finite_horizon_plot.m. They generated alpha-vectors given provided parameters. In finite_horizon_plot.m, one can specify the number of horizons and the function will plot the alpha-vectors for each time step. In infinite_horizon.m, the problem is solved in an infinite horizon setup where one can specify the discount factors. 

intersec.m, minksum.m and node.m are functions called by the main function, where interest.m finds the x axis of the cross point of two lines in a plane; miksum.m finds the minkowski summation of two sets; node.m finds all the cross points for each two lines in a set and returns the unique sorted set of x axis of all cross points. There are test cases for intesec.m and miksum.m.
